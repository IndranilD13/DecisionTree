# DecisionTree
This is a Python code that creates an Decision Tree in the form of a nested disctionary using GAIN calculation.
This the following function provide with the following data needed to create the tree


  frequency_finder -Returns the frequency of occurance of each categorical value
  
  
  Entropy-Returns the Entropy of Each Categorical value with respect to target and the entropy of target and total data present
  
  
  gain-returns the gain for each categorical value
  
  
  Tree-returns the tree in form of nested dictionary 
  
  
NOTE - This algorithm is designed for only binary classification.
